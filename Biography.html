<p>Hey there! I'm Tejal Saravanan, and I've just wrapped up my schooling in Bangalore, ready to dive into the exciting world of B.Tech IT at Chennai Institute of Technology. I'm an aspiring engineer, and my curiosity about how things work has always driven me. Growing up in Bangalore, I developed a strong academic foundation alongside a wide array of interests that truly define who I am.</p>
<p>Beyond my engineering dreams, I'm passionate about several things that keep me balanced and inspired. Sports have taught me invaluable lessons about teamwork, discipline, and pushing through challenges. My creative side thrives through dance and various art forms, which are my outlets for expression and innovative thinking. These activities aren't just hobbies; they're essential parts of my journey, helping me approach problems from different angles.</p>
<p>I believe in the power of continuous learning and always aim to make a positive impact. My approach to both my studies and my creative pursuits is guided by a desire for excellence and a meticulous eye for detail. I love finding connections between my engineering coursework and my artistic ventures, as I think interdisciplinary thinking is key. Whether I'm on the field, in the studio, or learning to code, I'm driven by a natural curiosity that pushes me to explore and grow.</p>
<p>As I begin my new chapter at Chennai Institute of Technology, I'm incredibly excited to immerse myself in Information Technology, collaborate on innovative projects, and further hone my skills as an engineer. My long-term aspiration is to leverage technology to create meaningful solutions for real-world problems, perhaps even blending my love for art or sports into future tech endeavors. I'm ready to learn, create, and inspire as I embark on this exciting journey.</p>
