<h1 style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Welcome To My Literary Corner!</b></u></h1>
<br>
<p style="font-size: larger;">Welcome, fellow bookworms and curious minds, to my little corner of the internet where stories come alive and new adventures are just a page-turn away! I'm Tejal, and much like a perfectly plotted mystery, my life is a blend of aspiring engineering, artistic flair, and an undeniable passion for the worlds hidden within books. Whether you're here to discover your next favorite read, curious about the magic behind my personal literary choices, or simply looking for a cozy spot to celebrate the joy of reading, you've found your happy place. So grab a comfy blanket, maybe a snack (or a giant stack of candy, if you dare!), and let's dive into the tales that have captivated my imagination and shaped my journey so far.</p>
